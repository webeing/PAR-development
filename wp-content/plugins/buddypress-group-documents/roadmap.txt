Ideas.
-Not neccessarity all of these will be implemented.  The ones near the top are more likely/sooner, and near the bottom are less likely/farther out.


Upload Folder
-----------------------
Create an "Upload" folder where site admins can upload large files via FTP without http POST restraints.  Also, several files could be uploaded at once.  The next time the admin visits the group documents settings page, documents could be labeled and moved to a group.


File Type Icons
---------------------------
Create a set of small icons, so that an icon appropriate for the file type is displayed next to the name


MIME Type Filtering
---------------------------
Currently, only the extension is filtered.  This provides weak security at best.  Include a mime type check to make it more rigorous.


More Visibility on Stream
---------------------------
Make use of BP 1.2's "message-text" field to add more information to the activity stream.  Perhaps adding the description.


Flexible file size limits
---------------------------
Give the admin control of the maximum file size that can be uploaded.  Currently the php.ini defaults are used.  After initial research, this seems difficult to implement, as set_ini() is not allowed on many server setups.


Smarter Widget
---------------------------
Currently the widget only shows updates for public groups.  This is to keep documents in private groups from being shown to everyone.  Perhaps have the widget check the current user's group memberships, and show all relevant recent documents to the active user.  Not sure about the performance hit here, as it would either require mulitple joins, or possibly a foreach loop and multiple querires.


Categories
---------------------------
Create a heirarchy for documents.  Users would select a category for the document on upload.  Group moderators could edit the category list.


Tags
---------------------------
Add a system where users can add tags documents.  Then, documents can be searched/filtered by any tag.


Comments
----------------------------
Add the ability for users to comment on documents
